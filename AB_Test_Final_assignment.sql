-- This code is the Final Project in Coursera's Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing course.

-- The assignment was to create an AB test for a eCommerce company, we have users, 
-- and we can alter their experience, but we also have items for sale. What would happen if we tested at an item-level?

-- Changing the way the items look for some portion of items.
-- Measuring “success” at an item level.
-- There are way more users than items, and we know the number of observations is important.
-- It might be a weird user experience to have inconsistent designs or interactions on different item pages.

-- Using ABBA website (https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html) to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 
-- orders_bin lift is -15% – 11% (-2.2%) and pval is 0.74
-- views_bin lift is and pval is -2.1% – 5.9% (1.9%) and pval is 0.36
-- for item_test_2, there was no significant difference in either the number of views or the number of orders between control and experiment
